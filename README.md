The aim of the project is to build a React single page application from scratch. We are to apply our knowledge of components, props and state management. We are to incorporate client-side routing and use data from an API

1. Set up a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
2. The app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized

4. Use the RESTful API: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
