# Learning Goals

The aim of the project is to build a React single page application from scratch. We are to apply our knowledge of components, props and state management. We are to incorporate client-side routing and use data from an API

## Requirements

1. Set up a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
2. The app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
4. Use the RESTful API: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all

### Deploying

When the project is complete, Deploy it! 

For your frontend, we recommend using NetlifyLinks to an external site.; however, there are a number of free services you can use if you'd like to explore alternatives.

## On the site as a User, you will:

*  You will be able to navigate the site using the hyperlinks (Home, Country List, Search), you will also be able navigate to the next page or the page before by sliding your finger in the desired direction on the mousepad.

*  Once you are on the Country List page You will to able to clickthrough to the Country Details by clicking on the card, this will fetch the data of the country clicked from the API and certain pre-set parameters for the respective country will show on the screen.

* To reiterate, you can either slide your finger to return to the previous page or click on the hyperlinks at the bootom of the screen (which are in the Footer component) or if the Header shows on screen you can choose to click those links to travel in your desired direction as well.

* in Search (the CountrySearch component) you will be able to search by submitting the name of said country and clicking the search button, then clicking the link with the country's name, this will send you to the Country Detail page.

* Note: the social media buttons on the bottom right of the screen are there for demonstration purposes, however they do link to their respective sources
